This ensures that gains are capitalized while maintaining the asset \\nallocation between Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund at 75%:25%.'),\n",

The age wise \\nportfolio distribution is shown in the table.\\n Asset allocation details at Policy inception and during the Policy term\\nLifecycle based Portfolio Strategy 2dUnder this strategy, your savings will initially be distributed between two funds Multi Cap Growth Fund, an equity-oriented \\nfund, and Income Fund, a debt oriented fund in a 75%: 25% proportion. The fund allocation may subsequently get altered \\ndue to market movements. We will re-balance funds in the portfolio based on a trigger event.\\nWorking of the strategy:\\n• The trigger event is deﬁned as a 10% upward or downward movement in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund, since the \\n previous rebalancing. For determining the ﬁrst trigger event, the movement of 10% in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund \\n (details on fund options available under the product are available in the “Choice of Funds” above) will be measured \\n vis-à-vis the NAV at the inception of your strategy.\\n• On the occurrence of the trigger event, any fund value in Multi Cap Growth Fund which is in excess of three times the \\n Income Fund, fund value is considered as gains and is transferred to the liquid fund - Money Market Fund by \\n cancellation of appropriate units from the Multi Cap Growth Fund. This ensures that gains are capitalised, while \\n maintaining the asset allocation between Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund at 75%:25%\\n• In case there are no gains to be capitalised, funds in Multi Cap Growth Fund, Income Fund and Money Market Fund are \\n redistributed in Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund in 75:25 proportion.\\nTrigger Portfolio Strategy 2 c'),\n",

If the last day of the \\nquarter is a non-working day, then the next working day’s NAV (i.e. the price per unit of the Fund) \\nwill be applicable.\\nc.   Trigger Portfolio Strategy 2\\nUnder this strategy, your savings will initially be distributed between two funds Multi Cap Growth \\nFund, an equity oriented fund, and Income Fund, a debt oriented fund in a 75%: 25% proportion. \\nThe fund allocation may subsequently get altered due to market movements. We will re-balance \\nfunds in the portfolio based on a trigger event.\\nWorking of the strategy:\\n•The trigger event is deﬁned as a 10% upward or downward movement in NAV of Multi Cap \\nGrowth Fund, since the previous rebalancing. For determining the ﬁrst trigger event, the \\nmovement of 10% in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund (details on fund options available under \\nthe product are available in the “Choice of Funds” above) will be measured vis-à-vis the NAV \\nat the inception of your strategy.a)   Fixed Portfolio Strategy\\nThis strategy enables you to manage your savings actively. Under this strategy, you may choose \\nto save your monies in any of the fund options (as detailed in “Choice of Funds” above) in \\nproportions of your choice.  You can switch monies amongst these funds using the switch option. \\nAutomatic Transfer Strategy\\nWithin the Fixed Portfolio Strategy, you also have the option to select Automatic Transfer \\nStrategy (ATS). \\nIt is not compulsory for the policyholder to select the Automatic Transfer Strategy. If this is chosen \\nyou can save all or part of your savings in Secure Opportunities Fund, Money Market Fund, Income \\nFund and/or Constant Maturity Fund and transfer a ﬁxed amount in regular instalments into one or \\nmore of the following funds: Bluechip Fund, Maximiser V, Multi Cap Growth Fund, Maximise India \\nFund, Value Enhancer Fund, Opportunities Fund, Focus 50 Fund, India Growth Fund, Balanced \\nAdvantage Fund, Sustainable Equity Fund, Mid Cap Fund, Mid Cap Hybrid Growth Fund, Mid Cap \\nIndex Fund, Mid Cap 150 Momentum 50 Index Fund, Multicap 50 25 25 Index Fund or MidSmall \\nCap 400 Index Fund. \\nSimilarly, you can choose to save all or part of your savings in one or more of the following funds: \\nBluechip Fund, Maximiser V, Multi Cap Growth Fund, Maximise India Fund, Value Enhancer Fund, \\n•On the occurrence of the trigger event, any fund value in Multi Cap Growth Fund which is in \\nexcess of three times the Income Fund, fund value is considered as gains and is transferred to \\nthe liquid fund - Money Market Fund by cancellation of appropriate units from the Multi Cap \\nGrowth Fund. This ensures that gains are capitalized, while maintaining the asset allocation \\nbetween Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund at 75%:25%\\n•In case there are no gains to be capitalized, funds in Multi Cap Growth Fund, Income Fund and \\nMoney Market Fund are redistributed in Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund in 75:25 \\nproportion.\\nd.

For determining the ﬁrst trigger event, the \\nmovement of 10% in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund (details on fund options available under \\nthe product are available in the “Choice of Funds” above) will be measured vis-à-vis the NAV \\nat the inception of your strategy.a)   Fixed Portfolio Strategy\\nThis strategy enables you to manage your savings actively. Under this strategy, you may choose \\nto save your monies in any of the fund options (as detailed in “Choice of Funds” above) in \\nproportions of your choice.  You can switch monies amongst these funds using the switch option. \\nAutomatic Transfer Strategy\\nWithin the Fixed Portfolio Strategy, you also have the option to select Automatic Transfer \\nStrategy (ATS). \\nIt is not compulsory for the policyholder to select the Automatic Transfer Strategy.

The re-balancing of units shall \\nbe done on the last day of each Policy quarter. The above proportions shall apply until the last \\nten quarters of the Policy are remaining. \\n•Safety as you approach maturity\\nAs your Policy nears its maturity date, you need to ensure that short-term market volatility does \\nnot affect your accumulated savings.

If the last day of the quarter is a non-working day, \\nthen the next working day’s NAV will be applicable. You can avail this option at inception or at any time later during the Policy Term.\\nTarget Asset Allocation Strategy1\\nFor any customer, maintaining a pre-deﬁned asset allocation is a dynamic process and is a function of constantly changing \\nmarkets. The Trigger Portfolio Strategy 2 enables you to take advantage of substantial equity market swings and save on \\nthe principle of “buy low, sell high”. \\nUnder this strategy, your savings will initially be distributed between two funds Multi Cap Growth Fund, an equity oriented \\nfund, and Income Fund, a debt oriented fund in a 75%: 25% proportion. The fund allocation may subsequently get altered \\ndue to market movements. We will re-balance funds in the portfolio based on a pre-deﬁned trigger event.\\nWorking of the strategy:\\n• The trigger event is deﬁned as a 10% upward or downward movement in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund, since the \\nprevious rebalancing. For determining the ﬁrst trigger event, the movement of 10% in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund will \\nbe measured vis-à-vis the NAV at the inception of your strategy.\\n• On the occurrence of the trigger event, any fund value in Multi Cap Growth Fund which is in excess of three times the \\nIncome Fund, fund value is considered as gains and is transferred to the liquid fund - Money Market Fund by cancellation \\nof appropriate units from the Multi Cap Growth Fund. This ensures that gains are capitalized, while maintaining the \\nasset allocation between Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund at 75%:25%\\n• In case there are no gains to be capitalized, funds in Multi Cap Growth Fund, Income Fund and Money Market Fund are \\nredistributed in Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund in 75:25 proportion.\\nTrigger Portfolio Strategy 22'),\n",

The fund allocation may \\nsubsequently get altered due to market movements. We will re-balance funds in the portfolio based on a pre-deﬁned \\ntrigger event.\\nWorking of the strategy:\\n• The trigger event is deﬁned as a 10% upward or downward movement in NAV of Multi Cap Growth Fund, since \\nthe previous rebalancing. For determining the ﬁrst trigger event, the movement of 10% in NAV of Multi Cap \\nGrowth Fund will be measured vis-à-vis the NAV at the inception of your strategy.\\n• On the occurrence of the trigger event, any fund value in Multi Cap Growth Fund which is in excess of three times \\nthe Income Fund, fund value is considered as gains and is transferred to the liquid fund - Money Market Fund by \\ncancellation of appropriate units from the Multi Cap Growth Fund. This ensures that gains are capitalized, while \\nmaintaining the asset allocation between Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund at 75%:25%.\\n• In case there are no gains to be capitalized, funds in Multi Cap Growth Fund, Income Fund and Money Market \\nFund are redistributed in Multi Cap Growth Fund and Income Fund in 75:25 proportion.\\n2 Trigger Portfolio Strategy 2'),\n",

Contingent Reversionar y Bonus, if declared will only be added explicitly to policies that become paid-up. \\nContingent Reversionar y Bonus, if declared is also payable for premium paying or fully paid policies that \\nare surrendered. The Contingent Reversionar y Bonus will be set such that the value of paid-up policies, \\nand surrendering policies will be related to the asset share. If you have chosen a speciﬁc date to receive Guaranteed Income, the income, as applicable, payable from this \\ndate will be increased for the deferment period i.e. for completed number of months between the due date of \\npay-out and the speciﬁc date chosen, at an interest rate equal to Reverse Repo Rate, compounded monthly. \\nst st \\nThis interest rate on GIs will be reviewed twice every year on 1of June and 1 of December, and will be set \\nequal to Reverse Repo Rate published on RBI’s website. The current Reverse Repo Rate as at June 1, 2022 is \\n3.35% p.a. Any change in bases used for determination of applicable interest rate will be subject to prior \\napproval from IRDAI and will be disclosed to policyholders.\\nThe last GI will be paid on the date of maturity of the policy and not on the special date chosen by You and \\ntherefore, the interest rate mentioned above shall not be applicable for the last GI.\"),\n",
